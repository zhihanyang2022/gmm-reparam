# Fitting mixtures of full-rank Gaussians using gradient

This repo provides a minimal PyTorch implementation of a finite mixture of full-rank Gaussians that can be fitted by directly optimizing its log-likelihood function using gradient ascent. Below are two ways to use this repo.

## Example 1: density estimation given a dataset

```{python}
# Let's try something other than EM
print("Helloworld!")
```

## Example 2: variational inference given the log of an unnormalized density 

```{python}
print("Helloworld!")
```
